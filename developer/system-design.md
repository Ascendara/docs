# System Design

## Core Architecture

Ascendara's architecture is built around four primary systems that work in harmony to deliver a seamless gaming experience. Let's explore how these systems interact and manage your gaming environment.

## The Control Center: Main Process

The Electron main process serves as Ascendara's control center, orchestrating all major operations. It manages application windows with precision, maintaining smooth transitions and optimal performance. This central hub handles deep system integration, controlling processes and file operations while keeping your Discord status in sync with your gaming activities.

## Game Management Suite

The game management system is your personal gaming concierge. It handles everything from launching games to monitoring their performance, ensuring each title runs exactly as intended. Before each launch, it performs thorough file verification to prevent corruption issues. The system also accommodates custom games, allowing you to integrate your entire gaming library into Ascendara, complete with convenient desktop shortcuts for quick access.

## Download Infrastructure

The download system is engineered for reliability and performance. It provides real-time visibility into your downloads with detailed progress tracking and statistics. When downloads complete, the system handles file extraction automatically, organizing everything into a clean directory structure. This intelligent system ensures your games are downloaded efficiently and stored logically.

## Update Framework

The update system works quietly in the background to keep Ascendara current. It periodically checks for new versions, downloads updates efficiently, and verifies their integrity before installation. This process is designed to be seamless, with background downloads that don't interrupt your gaming experience.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Game Launch Sequence

When you launch a game through Ascendara, a sophisticated sequence of events unfolds. First, the system validates the launch request and verifies all necessary files. It then prepares the gaming environment, configuring any required settings or dependencies. Once everything is ready, the game executes while Ascendara monitors its performance, ready to handle any issues that might arise.

### Download Orchestration

The download process is a carefully choreographed sequence of operations. It begins with initialization, where the system prepares for the download and allocates resources. Throughout the download, you'll see real-time progress updates and speed statistics. Once complete, the system verifies the downloaded files for integrity, extracts any compressed content, and finalizes the installation, ensuring everything is ready for play.

### Update Lifecycle

Ascendara's update process is designed to be both efficient and unobtrusive. The system periodically checks for new versions in the background. When an update is available, it's downloaded automatically and verified for security. The installation process is optimized to minimize disruption, with automatic restarts only when absolutely necessary to apply critical updates.
