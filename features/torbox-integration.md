# TorBox Debrid Service

> **Important:** Ascendara requires at least the Essential plan ($3/month) to function properly, as it needs the unlimited hoster downloads feature.

TorBox is a premium seedbox service that rivals even the best servers on the market. It provides users with a range of features for downloading and seeding content, with various plan options to suit different needs. TorBox allows you to download content from various sources including torrents, hosters, and Usenet, all while maintaining high speeds and reliability.

## TorBox Plans

TorBox offers several subscription tiers to accommodate different usage patterns:

- **Free Plan** ($0/month) - Basic features for trying out the service
- **Essential Plan** ($3/month) - **Minimum Required for Ascendara**
- **Standard Plan** ($5/month) - For moderate usage with more features
- **Pro Plan** ($10/month) - For power users with maximum capabilities
