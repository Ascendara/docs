# Core Concepts

Ascendara's architecture is built on several fundamental pillars that work together seamlessly to provide a robust gaming platform. Let's explore how these components interact to create your gaming experience.

## The Foundation: Main Process

At the heart of Ascendara lies the main Electron process, serving as the foundation for all operations. This process orchestrates the entire application, managing everything from window displays to system integration. It maintains communication with your operating system, handles critical file operations, and keeps your Discord status up-to-date, ensuring your friends always know what you're playing.

## Game Management System

The game management system is your personal gaming concierge. It takes care of launching your games with precision, monitoring their performance, and ensuring they run smoothly. This system verifies your game files before launch, supports custom game configurations, and even creates convenient desktop shortcuts for quick access. Whether you're playing a popular title or a custom-added game, the management system ensures a seamless gaming experience.

## Download Infrastructure
