# Welcome to Ascendara

Ascendara is your all-in-one gaming companion, designed to revolutionize how you discover, download, and manage your games. Let's explore what makes Ascendara special and how it enhances your gaming experience.

## Game Discovery Made Simple

Finding your next favorite game has never been easier. Ascendara provides access to an extensive and regularly updated game library, complete with detailed information about each title. Ascendara's intelligent search system helps you quickly find exactly what you're looking for, whether you're searching by title, genre, or other criteria. Each game comes with comprehensive details and metadata, helping you make informed decisions about what to play next.

## Advanced Download Management

At the heart of Ascendara lies a powerful download manager built for performance and reliability. Downloads are optimized for maximum speed while being gentle on your system resources. The smart resume feature ensures that interrupted downloads pick up right where they left off, and the built-in auto-extraction system handles compressed files automatically. You're always in control with the ability to manage multiple downloads simultaneously and choose exactly where your games are stored.

## Download Games in 2 Clicks

For supported games using GoFile.io as their source provider, Ascendara offers seamless downloads - a feature that lets you start downloads directly within the app without any browser interaction or captcha verification. Look for the lightning bolt icon next to the download button for games that support this feature.

## Smooth Gaming Experience

Once games are downloaded, launching them becomes a breeze. Start any game with a single click while the technical details are handled in the background. The smart process management system ensures games run smoothly while keeping system resource usage in check. However, due to the nature of game preservation and the constant evolution of gaming platforms, some older games may require additional configuration or might not be compatible with modern systems. Custom games not in the library can be easily added to enjoy the same streamlined launch experience.

## Ascendara Timemachine

The Ascendara Timemachine is a archival feature that lets you access previous versions of games from the database. With archives going back approximately one year, you can retrieve older versions of games that may have gone through changes over the time. However, please be aware that download success rates for older versions can vary significantly depending on the game's age. The Timemachine feature is particularly valuable for preserving gaming history and accessing specific versions of games for compatibility or preference reasons.

## Modern Interface

Ascendara believes that managing your games should be as enjoyable as playing them. Ascendara's interface is designed with modern aesthetics and user experience in mind. The clean, intuitive layout makes navigation effortless, while real-time progress tracking keeps you informed about your downloads and installations. Whether you're browsing the game library, managing downloads, or launching games, everything feels natural and responsive.

## Community Trust & Safety

Security is Ascendara's priority. Ascendara implements a community-driven trust system where users can verify and vouch for games. This collaborative approach, combined with Ascendara's thorough vetting process, helps ensure a safe gaming environment for everyone. Regular updates and automatic crash recovery features keep the application running smoothly, while Discord integration lets your friends know what you're playing.

## Username Customization

Ascendara gives you the ability to customize your in-game username through the pencil icon in the library's upper right corner. This changes your name for cracked games. Some games in your library might not use the Goldberg crack, and in these cases changing your username won't have any effect - these games typically have their own username systems or account requirements that work differently. This is normal and depends on how each game is set up. There's no reliable way to automatically detect which cracking method a game uses. The files and methods used can be similar across different cracks, and the internal workings aren't always visible or documented. This is why Ascendara can't tell you upfront whether username customization will work for a specific game. Content will be downloaded in a seperate directory where you can manage and do the rest.

## Ascendara Workshop Downloader

The Ascendara Workshop Downloader is a page you can toggle within the Settings of the app, where you can download items from the Steam workshop. SteamCMD is required in order to use the Ascendara Workshop Downloader, it will be automatically downloaded and installed if you don't have it. Some games may NOT download items because the owner of the game has set it to private, which would mean you need to sign into a Steam account with the game purchased.

## Continuous Evolution

As an open-source project, Ascendara is constantly evolving with new features and improvements driven by community feedback. Ascendara is developed with a focus on user friendliness and accessibility, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a seamless gaming experience.
