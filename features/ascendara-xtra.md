# Additional Game Information

## What is Ascendara Xtra?
Ascendara Xtra is a feature that enhances your game browsing experience by providing rich metadata for your games, including cover art, descriptions, release dates, and developer information. This information appears when you scroll down to the new card in the games download page or new play-game page.

> **Note:** Ascendara now uses the Steam API by default, which is integrated directly into the application. No manual setup is required!

## Game Information Provider

### Steam API
Ascendara now uses the Steam API as its primary game information provider. The Steam API is integrated directly into Ascendara and requires **no manual setup or API keys**. It provides:

- Comprehensive game metadata from Steam's extensive database
- High-quality cover art and screenshots
- Detailed game descriptions and information
- Release dates and developer/publisher information
- Genre and category data
- User reviews and ratings
- Regular automatic updates

The Steam API integration works seamlessly out of the box, providing reliable and up-to-date game information without any configuration needed.

### Deprecated Providers

> **⚠️ Important Notice:** The following providers are no longer supported in Ascendara:
>
> - **GiantBomb**: GiantBomb has discontinued their API service and transitioned to a forum-based wiki model. They are no longer serving API requests.
> - **IGDB**: IGDB integration has been removed in favor of the Steam API, which provides better coverage and requires no manual setup.
