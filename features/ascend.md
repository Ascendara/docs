# Ascend

Ascend is the premium subscription service for Ascendara, designed to unlock powerful features while directly supporting the solo developer behind the project. With Ascend, you gain access to cloud saves, friend activity, automatic game updates, and more—all while helping keep Ascendara alive and growing. Every new subscriber gets a free 7-day trial to experience everything Ascend has to offer before committing.

## Supporting Independent Development

Ascendara is built and maintained entirely by a solo developer. Unlike large companies with dedicated teams and corporate funding, Ascendara relies on its community to stay online and continue evolving. Your Ascend subscription is the most direct and impactful way to support this work.

Subscription revenue goes directly toward keeping the servers running 24/7, maintaining the API infrastructure that powers game indexing and downloads, funding secure cloud storage for user data, and enabling continuous development of new features and improvements. Every subscription matters—it's what keeps the games indexed, the community thriving, and the project moving forward. When you subscribe to Ascend, you're not just unlocking features; you're investing in the future of Ascendara.

## Premium Features

Ascend unlocks a suite of premium features designed to enhance every aspect of your Ascendara experience.

**Friends & Status** lets you connect with other Ascendara users and see their online status in real-time. Build your gaming community within the app and always know when your friends are playing. It's a simple way to stay connected and discover what others in your network are enjoying.

**Stats & Game Viewing** gives you insight into your own gaming habits and lets you see what others are playing. You can make your profile public to share your achievements and game history with friends, or keep it private if you prefer. This feature also helps you discover new games through your network—see what's popular among people you know and find your next favorite title.

**Cloud Syncing** automatically saves your achievements and playtime to the cloud. Your complete gaming history is accessible from anywhere, on any device. No more worrying about losing progress when switching computers or reinstalling—your data follows you wherever you go.

**Game Updating** keeps your library current with minimal effort. Ascend notifies you when updates are available for your games and lets you install them with a single click. No more manually checking for patches or hunting down update files—Ascend handles it all seamlessly in the background.

## Getting Started with Ascend

Joining Ascend is straightforward and takes just a few minutes. First, make sure you have Ascendara installed and set up on your system. If you haven't done this yet, download Ascendara from the official website and complete the initial setup process.

Once Ascendara is ready, open the app and create your Ascend account directly within the application. This account is separate from any other accounts you may have and is specifically for accessing Ascend features. After your account is created, navigate to Settings and look for the Ascend subscription option. From there, you can start your free 7-day trial and immediately begin using all premium features.

After your trial period ends, you can choose to continue your subscription to maintain access to all premium features. Your continued support helps ensure Ascendara keeps growing and improving for everyone in the community.

## Privacy, Security & Abuse Prevention

Ascendara takes the security of your account and the integrity of the Ascend service seriously. To prevent abuse of the subscription system—such as account sharing, fraudulent trial usage, or other forms of exploitation—Ascendara collects and stores a hardware identifier (HWID) from your device when you create an Ascend account.

Your hardware ID is generated from components of your system and serves as a unique fingerprint for your device. This identifier is securely encrypted and stored on Ascendara's servers, where it is used exclusively for abuse prevention purposes. It is never shared with third parties, never used for tracking or advertising, and never sold to anyone. The sole purpose of collecting this information is to ensure that each subscription is used fairly and that the free trial system isn't exploited.

This approach helps maintain a level playing field for all subscribers and protects the resources that keep Ascendara running. If you have concerns about hardware ID collection or need to transfer your subscription to a new device, reach out through the [Discord community](https://ascendara.app/discord) for assistance.
