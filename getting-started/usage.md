# Using Ascendara

## Installation
Ascendara is designed to run on Windows 10/11. Download the installer from the [website](https://ascendara.app/).

Simply run the installer and wait for Ascendara to be installed to your computer. You may get a blue window popup warning you that you're running a unsafe file. This is just because the exe is not signed by Microsoft. Click "More info" then "Run anyway".

## First Time Setup
When first launching Ascendara, you'll experience:

1. **Welcome Popup**: Initial welcome message
2. **Extension Installation**: Prompt to install the [Ascendara Download Handler](https://ascendara.app/extension) chrome extension (highly recommended)
3. **Game Dependencies**: Option to install common game runtime libraries:
   * .NET Framework
   * DirectX
   * OpenAL
   * Visual C++ Redistributable
   * XNA Framework Redistributable

These dependencies are basic game runtime libraries that most games need. If you've played games before, you can skip this step, though installing them won't cause any issues.

## Game Search
The game search is your starting point in Ascendara, offering access to over 2,000 games.
