# Ascendara (asend-era)

## What is Ascendara?
Ascendara is a user-friendly game discovery and download management application created by [tago](https://tago.works/). It organizes game links from trusted sources through a custom-developed public API, connecting to a database of verified game testing links. The application serves as both a game discovery tool and a download manager, allowing users to try games before purchasing.

The project, which began about 10 months ago, remains actively maintained with regular updates and improvements. Recently, it underwent a [complete UI overhaul](https://ascendara.app/v7) to provide a more modern and user-friendly experience. You can find Ascendara at [ascendara.app](https://ascendara.app/), where everything from the website to the application's source code is openly available and developed with dedication by tago.

## Outsourced Links
Game Files Are Never Stored on Ascendara's Servers. Ascendara operates as a game testing intermediary application, focusing on providing users with the ability to evaluate games before purchase. Games are downloaded from providers like MegaDB, GoFile, buzzheavier, and others.

## Core Principles

### Safety and Privacy First
Ascendara is built with user safety and privacy as core foundations. The application implements a robust trust system for game verification, while never storing any game files on its servers - only managing verified testing links. This approach ensures both content integrity and user privacy, operating with minimal data collection and maximum transparency.

### Public API Infrastructure
Ascendara's infrastructure is powered by a public API that primarily manages game testing listings and version information. This open approach allows developers to integrate with Ascendara's game testing database while maintaining a lightweight and efficient system. The API is publicly accessible, with documentation available [here](https://ascendara.app/docs/api-reference/overview), excluding only essential security features like app reporting.
