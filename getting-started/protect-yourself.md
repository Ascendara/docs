# Staying Safe on Ascendara

Understanding the risks and protecting yourself online is essential. Please note that Ascendara is not responsible for any damage that you do to your device.

## Ascendara Download Manager

Ascendara features a custom-developed download manager designed to make game downloads safer and more efficient. While some games support seamless downloads, others require you to manually catch the download link and use it in Ascendara.

## Download Process

### Seamless Downloads
Some games support automatic downloads if you have seamless downloads enabled in settings. For these games, Ascendara will handle everything automatically.

### Manual Downloads
For other games, you'll need to navigate through the file host site carefully until you reach the actual download. You can either manually copy the download link, or use the Download Handler extension to help catch it when the real download starts.

### Download Handler Extension
The Ascendara Download Handler extension intercepts the actual download when it starts and sends it straight to the Ascendara application. This ensures that your downloads are handled safely.

## Watch Out For

### Deceptive Download Buttons
File hosts display multiple fake "Download Now" buttons. When catching a download link, be patient and wait for the real download to become available after the countdown.

### Misleading Pop-ups
Ignore pop-ups claiming you need additional software or updates. These are scams trying to install unwanted programs or malware on your system.

## Common Examples

### File Host Page
A typical file host page might show:

❌ Multiple colorful "Download Now" buttons (These are ads)  
❌ "Your download is ready!" pop-ups with fake download buttons  
❌ "Install Download Manager" or "Update Required" pop-ups  
✅ A countdown timer (Usually legitimate - wait for it)  
✅ Small, plain "Download" link after countdown (Usually legitimate)  

### Red Flags
Signs that something is probably an ad or scam:

⚠️ Large, colorful buttons appearing before the countdown ends  
⚠️ Pop-ups asking you to install additional software  
⚠️ Multiple download buttons visible at the same time  
⚠️ System alert style pop-ups claiming you need updates  

## Stay Safe

Whether using seamless downloads or manually catching download links, always let Ascendara's download manager handle the actual file download and installation process.

> **Remember:** Never download or run any additional software suggested by file hosting sites. Ascendara is the only program you need to download and install your games.
