# Virtual Reality (VR) Games and Ascendara

## Ascendara VR Compatibility
VR games typically require direct integration with platforms like SteamVR or Meta Quest Link to properly connect to your headset. When launching VR games through Ascendara, these connections may not function correctly. For the best VR experience, launch VR games directly through SteamVR or Meta Quest Link.

## Adding VR Games to Steam
1. Open Steam and click on "Add a Game" on the bottom left
2. Select "Add a Non-Steam Game"
3. Wait for it to load then click "Browse" and locate your VR game's executable file
4. Make sure to check the box next to the game and click "Add Selected Programs"
5. In your Steam library, right-click the newly added game
6. Select "Properties"
7. Check "Include in VR Library"

### Tips for Steam VR Setup
- Ensure SteamVR is installed and up to date
- Make sure your VR headset is properly connected before launching the game
- Some games may require additional VR-specific launch parameters
- If the game doesn't appear in VR mode, verify it's showing up in your SteamVR library

## Adding Games to Meta Quest Link

1. Open the Meta Quest Link app
2. Go to Settings â†’ General
3. Enable "Unknown Sources"
4. Click on "Library" in the left sidebar
5. Select the "+" icon at the top right
6. Browse to your game's executable file
7. Give the game a name and add any required launch parameters
8. The game will now appear in your Oculus Library under "Unknown Sources"

## Which should I use?
Both SteamVR and Meta Quest Link are viable options. If one platform doesn't work well with your game, try the other. There's no significant advantage to either platform, so use whichever works best for your specific game.

If you're using a Meta headset and want to play SteamVR games, it may be best to set Oculus Runtime as the default OpenXR runtime and launch SteamVR games through it. This avoids extra overhead from running SteamVR on top of the Oculus software.

## Troubleshooting VR Issues
- **No VR Detection**: Ensure your VR runtime (SteamVR/Oculus) is running before launching games
- **Performance Issues**: 
  - Check if your PC meets the VR game's requirements
  - Update graphics drivers
  - Close background applications
  - Verify USB connection quality for PC VR
- **Controller Issues**:
  - Recalibrate controllers in SteamVR/Oculus settings
  - Check controller battery levels
  - Ensure proper tracking space setup
- **Display Problems**:
  - Verify headset connection
  - Check display refresh rate settings
  - Adjust rendering resolution if experiencing performance issues

Remember that running VR games through platforms they weren't designed for may cause compatibility issues. For the best experience, use the platform the game was intended for.
