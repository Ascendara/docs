## Common Issues and Solutions

### Downloading Problems
Slow downloads or interruptions can often be resolved by checking your network connection or using a download manager. If you encounter "File not found" errors, verify that the download link is current and valid.

### Extraction Difficulties
When facing "Cannot open file as archive" errors, the download may be incomplete or corrupted. Try re-downloading the file. Ensure you have sufficient disk space for extraction and, if required, the correct password for protected archives.

### Verification Issues
After a game downloads and extracts successfully, Ascendara will automatically verify the game files and ensure everything extracted correctly. If the verification fails your antivirus may be flagging crack files as false positives. Try disabling antivirus temporarilly and manually extracting the file that was deleted to the location specified in the verficiation error. If a game file was deleted after the game was already successfully installed and verified before, the games original compressed file will not be saved unless you saved it manually. You will have to re-download the game again.

### Game Launch Failures
If a game fails to start, verify that your system meets the minimum requirements and that all game files are present. For black screens, update your graphics drivers and ensure DirectX is installed. If the game crashes on startup, try running in compatibility mode and check for conflicting applications.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. Verify your internet connection and download integrity
2. Ensure sufficient disk space for game installation
3. Update graphics drivers and DirectX
4. Check system compatibility with game requirements
5. Use file verification tools to confirm game file integrity
6. Try running the game in compatibility mode if issues persist

### Executable Not Found Launch Error
This error occurs when Ascendara cannot locate the game's executable file. By default, Ascendara looks for an executable with the same name as the game in the download directory.

To resolve this, update the executable path to its correct location. Once set, Ascendara will remember this path for future launches.

## GameX Launch Issues
The game handler script may experience issues launching certain games due to various factors:

### Anti-Cheat and DRM
- Games with anti-cheat mechanisms may detect script launches as suspicious
- Strict DRM systems might crash if not launched through their expected launcher

### Environment and Permissions
- Missing environment variables required by the game
- Incorrect working directory during launch
- Insufficient file access permissions
- Missing elevated privileges

### Process Handling
- Buffering issues with stdout/stderr
- Improper signal handling
- Timing-sensitive initialization issues

### System Integration
- Graphics driver detection problems
- Audio initialization failures
- Missing or conflicting dynamic libraries
- Communication issues with external services

### Resource Management
- Insufficient memory allocation
- CPU resource constraints
- Parent process resource consumption affecting game performance

## Download Issues
- **Slow downloads**: Check your internet connection and try using a different network.
- **Failed downloads**: Ensure enough disk space and try disabling antivirus temporarily.
- **Extraction errors**: Make sure you have write permissions in the installation directory.

#### Content type error
If you're experiencing this error, it's likely the download link from the provider has expired. Some providers do this
to prevent download abuse. All you need to do is cancel the download and try again.

#### No files error
This error occurs when the download link from the provider has been removed. If you get this error it should be automatically
cancelled and reported to be removed or updated. At the moment the only thing you can try is a different provider if available.

## Performance Issues
- **Lag or stuttering**: Close background applications and update system drivers.
- **High CPU usage**: Check for system updates and scan for malware.
- **Memory issues**: Ensure your system meets the recommended requirements.
